Or</li><li>Though in power over the nations, they really are as they say under “chains and… fetters”, i.e., is they are under some sort of punishment from Yahweh</li></ol><h3>Spiritual Rulers in Chains and Fetters</h3><p>As pointed out, these kings and rulers are not made up of human rulers only, but, even more, of the spiritual rulers of the nations [Deut 32:8; Psa 8; Isa 24:21].<br>That these <em>spiritual</em> rulers are in chains just as the angels who sinned before the flood were points to them being the same<em>—Psa 2:3 Septuagint (cf., Jud 1:6 the angels who sinned being “in everlasting bonds under darkness”)</em>.</p><h3>Earthly Rulers in Chains and Fetters</h3><p>Although this Psalm applies to time before the second coming of Christ [Act 4:24-28], it has an eye to a time when Christ has been enthroned on Zion as king which is from his second coming forward [Mat 23:39]. At present, before his second coming, he is ruling from the Father’s Throne and has not commenced rule from his own <strong>Throne</strong> [1Co 15:22-25; Rev 12:5; 3:21; 5:6].</p><p>With regard to the nations after the coming of Christ, they will indeed be under a stern rule [Zec 14:16-19] as even this Psalm testifies [Psa 2:9] and so will indeed be under “chains and… fetters”.</p>"

            "_1": "<h2>God’s Glory Set Above/On the Heavens</h2><p>God has set his glory upon the heavens, that is, God has bestowed His glory upon the heavens <em>(H5414, נָתַן, nâthan cf., Moses put some of his authority on Joshua—Num 27:20; 1Ch 29:25)</em>.</p><p>That is, God has honored the heavens. God has crowned heaven with His glory.</p><p>How has God honored heaven?</p><ol><li>By the very fact that God’s Presence is in Heaven, by the fact that Heaven is God’s residence [Mat 6:9; Joh 14:2]. This naturally results in the following facts.</li><li><em>Heaven is honored and glorified </em>by the fact that <strong>heaven</strong> and <strong>the inhabitants of heaven</strong> are not mortal and weak and easily subject to corruption <em>(as the earth and her inhabitants are) </em>[Mat 6:20; 1Co 15:40-49].</li></ol><p>This is just as among men where the capital city of nations, or the capital nation of empires is usually greater in beauty, excellence, infrastructure, defence, quality of life, quality of citizens, etc., than other cities in the nation or nations in the empire [Dan 4:30].</p>",
            "_2": "<p><em>cf., Psa 44:15-17</em></p><ol><li>God has enemies,</li><li>Apparently under the authority of one who is called “the avenger”</li><li>God chose “babes and sucklings” to declare his praise/strength in order to still the enemies</li></ol><h2>Babies</h2><p>Babies are characterized by</p><ol><li>A lack of knowledge—they are ignorant [Matt 11:25]—and</li><li>Weakness—compared to adults, they are not physically and mentally strong. For example, they cannot defend themselves</li></ol><p>So, God chose ignorant and weak men to still His enemies. Choosing the ignorant and weak, choosing the unlikely is something God does consistently as the Scriptures show and understanding why God does this, we can see that, compared to man, the enemies are quite wise and strong.</p><h2>Why Babies? Why the Weak and Ignorant?</h2><p>So why does God do this?</p><p>Well, as Paul points out, it is to stop the boast of those who may be considered or who may consider themselves wise and/or powerful [1Cor 1:27]. God wants all to know that He is the One in charge and so no one should think that it is simply by his or their own  own wisdom or power that they are getting anything done [1Sam 2:9]</p><ul><li>Consider the account of Sennacherib of Assyria. God brought Sennacherib up against Jerusalem, plainly stating that He Yahweh was the One who ruled over the affairs of men determinning what will and what will not be. However, Sennacherib believed that it was by his own power and wisdom that he had come as far as Jerusalem. Therefore, when God destroyed his army and eventually had him killed, God was making a statement that He Yahweh was the One who ruled over all the nations [Isa 37:20-29 <em>cf.,</em> Isa 37:36-38].</li><li>Long before Yahweh raised Sennacherib, Yahweh had spoken through Moses. He spoke of the enemies raised by God to accomplish His purposes but who would claim that it is by their own power and wisdom and will that they have done all they have [Deut 32:26-27,28-33].</li></ul><p>This gives insight into what is really going on.</p><p>The enemy, of course, is the devil and the rulers of the darkness of this world [Mat 13:25,39; Eph 6:12; Dan 10:13,20; Mat 25:41; Rev 12:7,9; Act 13:10].</p>",

In other words, it reminds David of the fact that heavenly beings are glorious to some good degree as God. <em><strong>What God gave the heavens is not simply light but his nature—the angels of God are, for example, spirits and fiery like God [Psa 104:4; Joh 4:24; Isa 31:3]</strong></em>.<br></p>",

These sons, however, rather than fight for the weak men who are under their watch, sided with the devil, the wicked one who oppresses men.</em><br></p><p><em>This greatly displeases God and he condemns them to death, which is normally not possible for their kind.</em><br></p></blockquote><p>According to this Psalm, God is not the only God, nevertheless, He is the Most High God and thus, the Only True God. It is important to note, from verse 6, that it was God who pronounced or made these others “gods”—they are not a misconception or ‘false belief’ of the author of this Psalm. Whether or not this agrees with the beliefs of the surrounding peoples, it did not originate with them but is God’s word!.</p><h3>The Assembly of the El</h3><p>The gods have an assembly and God (Elohim) is the one who presides over this assembly.</p><h3>He Gives Judgment Among the Elohim</h3><p><em>(Though Elohim stands for God Most High, it is also the plural form of god, i.e., gods. So, it is still the same group that is spoken of here.)</em></p><p>It is not that God judges the gods but that he gives judgment among them. This implies that there were at least two camps among the gods.</p>"
