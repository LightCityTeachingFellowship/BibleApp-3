            "_4": "<p><em>cf., Job 33:23</em></p><p>The “Angel of Yahweh” takes away sins.</p><p>Although the Angel of Yahweh represents God, in taking away the sin of Joshuah the High Priest, we must note that he did it in his own capacity. He did not attribute it to God the Father by saying, “Thus says Yahweh, I have taken away your sin” nor by identifying him apart from himself as, for example, “Yahweh who chose Jerusalem”.</p><p>No one can take away sin, that is forgive sin, except for God <em>the Father</em> and the Lord Jesus Christ [Mar 2:5,6-7,10-11; Luk 5:20,21,24-25]. Therefore, since the Angel of Yahweh took away the sins of Joshua the High Priest, and since he is not God the Father, then he is clearly the One we now know as the Lord Jesus.</p><h3>The Price of of Forgiveness</h3><p>One of the truths about sin the Scriptures teach us is that forgiving sin is never free. Of course, God can, if He wanted, forgive sins without any cost, but that is not the way He has chosen for sins to be forgiven. In God’s wisdom, the forgiveness of sin must come at a cost, it cannot be free. This has to be the case because sin must be discouraged.</p><p>If there was a possibility for sins to be forgiven without a cost, then how would that discourage sin? If one person was forgiven arbitrarily, then people may be inclined to taking the gamble. Also, if anyone is forgiven his sin without a cost, then another would demand in fairness to be granted the same unconditional privilege. If this happens, then, truly, justice would demand that his petition be granted. If God grants it, who will take the matter of sin seriously? But if God chose not to grant unconditional forgiveness, then he would be introducing injustice to the system. Now, since injustice is a sin, if God practiced it, He himself would be a sinner and would not be fit to condemn anyone as a sinner for then He would be condemning Himself.</p><p>Knowing then that the forgiveness of sins is not without cost, we may ask what the cost was for the taking away of Joshua’s sins?</p><h3>Forgiving Joshua</h3><p>As established in the Law of Moses with all sacrifices required for forgiveness, and as we can see from the practices of Moses, and from Elihu’s words [Job 33:23-26], there are three things that the Angel does to bring about forgiveness of sin,</p><ol><li>He intercedes for the sinner<br><ol><li>The punishment is from God/Heaven, therefore, even if he has the power to take away the punishment by himself, it will not guarantee his ward peace as God/Heaven can always impose another punishment on him. This is apart from the fact that he himself would be disrespecting God and interferring with His judgments if He did not have God’s permission to deliver the sinner.<br></li><li>Therefore, he must have God’s approval to release his ward from his sin. He may either seek an express approval from God or he may act knowing that  his action in helping the sinner is consitent with God’s decrees.</li><li>However, he cannot simply come to God/Heaven and sasy, “Just forgive him”,</li></ol></li><li>He provides an atonement, a ransom<ol><li>Since He cannot just release the sinner or tell God/Heaven, “Just forgive him”, he has to provide an acceptable insentive for forgiving the sinner. He has to provide some acceptable ransom or atonement for the sinner. It is either expressly demanded by God or must be something he knows to be consistent with God’s decrees.</li></ol></li><li>He tells the sinner what is good for him<br><ol><li>This is actually a necesary part of the atonement.</li></ol></li></ol><p>We find all this satisfied in the taking away of Joshua’s sin.</p><ol><li><strong>He had the Father’s Approval</strong>: Rebuking Satan by “Yahweh who chose Jerusalem” implies that Angel of Yahweh either has express approval from God the Father or he was acting in accord with His wishes. And, somehow, Satan knew that he was telling the truth and so did not press any further. If he wasn’t sure, he could go to the Father to get verification that the Angel of Yahweh really had His approval.</li><li><strong>He told Joshua what was right for him</strong>: After changing Joshua’s garments he told Joshua God’s requirements for his continuing to hold the office of the high priest.<br></li><li><strong>He provided atonement</strong>: In rebuking Satan, the AoY did not only indicate that He had God’s approval but that he states that Joshua was a branch plucked from the fire. This basically means that Joshua had been made to experience suffering. Since the real issue was Joshua serving as high priest, then his suffering was only an atonement. In other words, it was the Angel of Yahweh who had prescribed the fire.</li></ol><p> </p>",

            "_14": "<h2>Facts About The Two Anointed One’s</h2><ol><li>They are are prophets, since they are called anointed ones</li><li>They were already standing before Yahweh at the time of the vision</li><li>They are in heaven since that is where Yahweh is and they evidently were not on earth with Zechariah at the time</li><li>They were alive since they cannot stand before Yahweh if they are dead—<em>either they never died or they were raised back to life</em></li><li>They will still be alive at the end of time since this is a prophecy about what the Messiah would do in endtime.</li></ol><h3>“Standing”—<em>Not “Stood” or “Will Stand”</em>—Before the Lord</h3><p>Note that the angel does not speak of the two anointed in past or future tense but in present tense. He does not say, “the two anointed ones, that <em><u><strong>stood</strong></u></em>”, nor “the two anointed ones, that <strong><em><u>will stand</u></em></strong>” but “the two anointed ones, that stand before teh Lord of the whole earth”.</p><p>That is, these <em>two anointed ones </em>were already at the time of the vision standing before the Lord of the earth. Therefore, if they are men,</p><ol><li>First, at the time of the vision, they were in heaven,</li><li>Second, if they are men, since they cannot enter/serve in heaven if they are dead, then they were alive in heaven at the time of the vision.</li><li>Therefore, they either<ol><li>Had never died but were translated to heaven or</li><li>Died and were raised back to life and taken to heaven</li></ol></li></ol><h3>Other Defining Qualities of These Men</h3><p>The Apostle John speaks of these “two anointed ones” as the Two Witnesses [Rev 11:3-4].</p><p>There, in Revelation we learn about them that they have,</p><ol><li>Power to shut up the sky and keep it from raining [Rev 11:6]</li><li>They have the authority and power from God to kill anyone who tries to kill them with fire [Rev 11:5]</li></ol><h3>Elijah—One of the Two Anointed Ones</h3><p>Evidently, by his own testimony and the record of Scriptures, Elijah is one of them. Why?</p><ol><li>Because he “stands before Yahweh” [1Kgs 17:1;  18:15;  19:11] and</li><li>He was taken from the earth without dying [2Kgs 2:1,11].</li><li>Therefore, if he is alive, and he stands before Yahweh, then he has been standing before Yahweh.</li><li>Also, Elijah was evidently an anointed one as his Spirit rested upon Elisha [2Kgs 2:9-10,15]. <em>(This is particularly significant because he is one of the only two prophets in Scriptures who transferred their Spirit to another person)</em>.</li></ol><p>From John’s testimony about the Two Witness, the fact that these have power to defend themselves with fire shows that Elijah is one of the two. Elijah was one whose calling from God was validated with fire from heaven which consumed not just the sacrifice on mount Carmel, but also, as Revelation says, his enemies—the two camptains of fifty and their fifties [2Kin 1:10,12 cf., Rev 11:5]. Therefore, Elijah is quite easily identiified as one of the two anointed ones that stand before the Lord of the Earth.</p><p>The identification of Elijah as one of the two prophets is made more sure by the fact that the prophet Malachi identifies him by name. God very plainly declares through Malachi that He will send the prophet Elijah before the Day of Yahweh comes.</p><blockquote><p>“Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of Yahweh” [Mal 4:5].</p></blockquote><h3>The Other Anointed One</h3><p>We can identify the other anointed one as Moses from the following,</p><ol><li><strong><em>The Spirit Upon Them:</em></strong><ol><li>First, of all the prophets in the Bible, the only prophet whose Spirit was given to another was Moses.<ol><li>The Spirit was taken from Moses and given to the 70 elders [Num 11:25]. <em>As with Elijah and Elisha, Yahweh came down to make this happen</em>.</li><li>And before Moses was taken, he laid his hands on Joshua and he was filled with the Spirit of Wisdom [Deut 34:9].</li></ol></li><li>Second, no other prophet was as prolific with miracles. The quantity of miracles done by Elijah <em>(which includes those done by Elisha since he was standing in the office of Elijah [1Kgs 19:16])</em> is only matched by Moses.</li></ol></li><li><strong><em>Standing Before Yahweh:</em></strong><ol><li>Although we don’t read that Moses “stood before Yahweh”, the records show that he did [Exo 33:7-9].</li><li>Both Moses and Elijah went to speak to God at Horeb [1Kgs 19:8-11].<ol><li><em>Abraham stood before Yahweh [Gen 18:22;  19:27], but this was not in the same way as Elijah stood before Yahweh.</em></li><li>Moses stood between Yahweh and Israel [Deu 5:5]—<em>this was something he continually did</em></li><li>The Levites were chosen to stand before Yahweh [Deu 10:8;  18:7; 2Chr 29:11]—<em>this was under the law</em></li><li>Elijah stood before Yahweh [1Kgs 17:1;  18:15;  19:11]</li><li>Elisha stood before Yahweh [2Kgs 3:14;  5:16]—<em>Elisha was standing in the office of Elijah. In other words, Elijah was standing through him.</em></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><em><strong>The Destruction of Their Enemies By Fire</strong>:</em><ol><li>Like Elijah, Moses’ ministry was validated with fire from Yahweh’s presence and with fire destroying those who opposed him [Num 16:28-30,35;  26:9-10 cf., 1Kin 18:36-40]</li><li>Fire was the proof that they were sent from God and had done everything they had done according to God’s word to them.<ol><li>Elijah said, <em>“…let it be known this day that …I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.”</em> [1Kin 18:36]</li><li>Moses said, <em>“…Hereby you shall know that Yᵉhôvâh has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord.”</em> [Num 16:28]</li><li>And the response to both was fire from God’s presence [Num 16:35 <em>cf.,</em> 1Kin 18:35]</li></ol></li><li>With fire, those who opposed them were destroyed,<ol><li>For Moses, fire destroyed the 250 companions of Korah, Dathan and Abiram [Num 16:35]</li><li>For Elijah, fire consumed the two captains and their fifities [2Kin 1:10-11]</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><hr><h3>Moses, Elijah &amp; the Lord Jesus Christ</h3><p>Above is a beautiful fact to note and expound on.</p><p>The greatest miracle workers in Scriptures were Moses, Elijah (himself and through Elisha) and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>It is only these three that God had their Spirit given to another/others.</p><p>Now, <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">of the three, the Lord Jesus Christ is quite evidently by far the greatest</span></strong>. Quite evidently, as John the Baptist testified, God has given him the Spirit without measure and the evidence is in</p><ol><li>Both the <strong>quantity</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> of miracles and in</li><li>The distribution of his Spirit.</li></ol><p>Jesus is so great and has so much of the Spirit that even till today his men and women are still receiving his Spirit and healing and performing great miracles, signs and wonders.</p><p>Now, it is important to observe that in all cases of transfer of the Spirit, those who received the Spirit were an extension of the one from whom they received the Spirit.</p><ol><li>The Seventy Elders were anointed with Moses’ Spirit so that they could help him with his work.</li><li>Joshua received the Spirit of Wisdom through Moses’ laying on of hands so that he could carry on and finish the work Moses had started</li><li>Elisha also received the Spirit of Elijah so that he could stand in the office of Elijah and carry on his work.</li></ol><p>Therefore, the great number of Jesus’ disciples—past, present and future—who have and who are still receiving his Spirit show how great, how exceedingly great the Lord Jesus is. All of them are extensions of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>"
