However, he cannot be the one spoken of here since, to be a king which this prophecy says he will be, he would have to be a descendant of a king from David’s house and in line to the throne which Isaiah doesn’t seem to be.</p><p><em>(Some Jews believe that Isaiah was a member of the Davidic Royal family (</em><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/464019/jewish/Isaiah-The-Prophet.htm\" href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/464019/jewish/Isaiah-The-Prophet.htm\"><em>Isaiah The Prophet - Jewish History (chabad.org)</em></a><em>), however, I see no clear indication of this in scriptures.<br>If he really was in line for the Throne of David, prophesying that his son would be the king would be treason, since he would then be openly threatening to end the current line of David's sons. I don't see how Isaiah would have been so bold and would not have met with a severe consequence. In any case, Isaiah says that his sons are signs and not the actual thing.)</em></p><p>Paying attention to the <em>child/son </em>characters of Isaiah’s prophecy, the child that is born and the Son that is given is Immanuel whom he introduced in the sign given to the house of David when he met with king Ahaz [Isa 7:14]. <strong>Since </strong><strong>the child that is born and the Son that is given </strong><strong>is “Mighty God” and he is given to us, then he is “</strong>(<em>Mighty)</em><strong> God with us”, that is, “Emmanuel”</strong>. Therefore, the One who will sit on David’s Throne and be King over all Israel is still Emmanuel—the prophecy is still about Emmanuel.</p><p>Also, according to this prophecy, Immanuel the Messiah is “a great light” [Isa 9:2].</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"notes_img/Isa9.6.ChildSonIsEmmanuel.svg\" style=\"width: 100%;\">​​​​​​</img><h2><strong>The Messiah, the Prophesied Immanuel and the Angel of Yahweh</strong></h2><ol><li>As pointed out before, <strong>since </strong><strong>the child that is born and the Son that is given </strong><strong>is “Mighty God” and he is given to us, then he is “</strong>(<em>Mighty)</em><strong> God with us”, that is, “Emmanuel”</strong>.<ol><li>The only Emmanuel Israel had always known was the Angel of Yahweh who was regarded as God and was with them through their time in the wilderness [Exo 23:23; 33:14]. The Angel of Yahweh was to the Israelites, “God with us”<ol><li>He was the One with Jacob [Gen 31:3]</li><li>He was the One with Moses and with Joshua [Exo 3:12; Jos 1:5]</li><li>He was the One with Israel [Exo 17:7; Num 14:9; Deu 4:7; Jdg 6:13-14,16].</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Assyria’s invasion of the land of Judah, coming as far as Jerusalem will fail because of “Emmanuel”, because God is with Jerusalem [Isa 8:7-8 cf., Isa 8:10]. In other words, Emmanuel will deliver Jerusalem from the Assyrian king and his armies with him.<ol><li>This was literally fulfilled when Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, invaded the land of Judah coming as far as Jerusalem and his army was destroyed by the Angel of Yahweh [Isa 37:36]. This fulfilment clearly identifying the Angel of Yahweh as the Emmanuel to be born.</li></ol></li><li>In the prophecy of Emmanuel—the Light of Israel and her Holy One—delivering Israel from the Assyrians, Emmanuel is referred to again under the title “Mighty God” [Isa 10:21]</li><li>Again, in this prophecy, there is reference made to the deliverance of Israel under Gideon [Isa 10:26 cf., Jdg 7:25] and it will be remembered that this was by the Angel of Yahweh [Jdg 6:11,16,22].</li><li>From the prophecy’s reference back to Gideon’s story, we find another confirmation of the Angel of Yahweh as the prophesied Emmanuel<ol><li>In the account of the encounter, when Gideon feared that he would die for having seen the Angel of Yahweh, the Angel spoke peace to him and Gideon built an altar naming it “<strong>Yahweh Our Peace</strong>” [Jdg 6:22-24]. And “<strong>Peace</strong>” is in the name of the Child born unto us and the Son given unto us—his name shall be called, ”…<strong>Prince of Peace</strong>”.</li><li>Now, the word translated “<strong>Prince</strong>” is “H8269, sar, <strong>שַׂר</strong>” and is the very same word translated “<strong>Captain</strong>” in the title of the Angel of Yahweh when he appeared to Joshua referring to himself as “the Captain <em>(or prince</em>) of the host”. Thus, this is clearly a reference to the Angel of Yahweh, the Captain/Prince of the Host of Israel and their Peace<em> (who will save them from death)</em>.</li></ol></li></ol><p>The name “Emmanuel” would have naturally brought the Angel of Yahweh to the mind of any true Israelite who knew his people’s spiritual history well and was conscious of it.</p><p>The Angel of Yahweh had always been and is the only Emmanuel Israel had ever known. And in the days of Isaiah literally fulfilled the prophecy meant to be fulfilled by the prophesied child Emmanuel. Therefore, although it would have basically been impossible to conceive at the time, there being no such precedent, God literally meant that the Angel of Yahweh, who was Israel’s Emmanuel, would be conceived and given birth to as a child.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"notes_img/Isa9.6.AoY&ChildSon-portrait.svg\" style=\"width: 100%;\">​​​​​​</img>"

Therefore, the sun going back the ten steps it had gone down means that the time was reversed to before Isaiah had delivered the prophecy to Hezekiah.</p><p>The significance of this is that it made it possible for Yahweh to reverse His word that Hezekiah would die without violating His faithfulness. Basically, God rewinded time to nullify the decree that had been made.</p><p>Many times people say, “I wish I could take that back”, well Yahweh God literally did that, he reversed time to nullify a decree and establish a new one!</p><h2>What Happened—Did the Sun Really Move?</h2><p>The verse is very specific in what moved and it was the sun. The sun, not the light, not the reflection, but the sun went back ten steps it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz. Just as the sun and moon standing still for about a day cannot be explained away by natural explanations, such as, “It must have been an eclipse”, so too this cannot be explained away. There is simply no wriggle room.</p><p>Truly, this miracle defies human comprehension and natural explanations.</p><h2>The Purpose of the Sign</h2><ol><li>A sign from God that Hezekiah would live for another fifteen years [Isa 38:5-7,22]</li><li>A sign from God that God would deliver king Hezekiah and Jerusalem out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and will defend Jerusalem [Isa 38:5-7].</li></ol><h2>God’s Faithfulness</h2><h3>Reversing Time &amp; God’s Faithfulness</h3><p>Since the sun <em>(or the light of the sun)</em> is the main measure of time [Gen 1:3-5;  Gen 1:14-18], the sun going backwards implies are reversal of time. Therefore, God reversed time.</p><p>This is significant because it makes it possible for God to “go back on His word” which He had spoken concerning Hezekiah. By reversing time, God went back to the time before Isaiah had delivered the word and nullified that word.</p><h3>What About God’s Covenant With Day &amp; Night?</h3><blockquote><p>“Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season… <sub>25</sub>Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” [Jer 33:20,25]</p></blockquote><p>Does causing the sun to go backwards not violate God’s covenant with day and night as stated in Jeremiah?</p><p>If the covenant was violated, then it was too under Joshua when God caused the sun and moon to stand still for about a day [Jos 10:13]. However, since God never violates His word, it means that the covenant of day and night does not forbid</p><ol><li>The pausing of day and night for a period nor</li><li>The sun going backwards</li></ol><p>No it doesn’t violate the covenant of day and night</p><ol><li>It is man <em>(and by extension, other beings) </em>that God asked if they could break the covenant, and not God.</li><li>They still come in their “season”.</li></ol><hr><h2>The Geographic Extent of The Sign</h2><p>We read in Second Chronicles that the Babylonians came to inquire about what had been done in the land [2Chr 32:31].</p><p>But what land—the whole earth or just the land of Judah? — <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">please see note on 2Chr 32:31</span>.</em></p><pre><strong>The Whole World</strong></pre><p>Our understanding of the world is that the sun could not have moved forward or backward without it being evenly observed in all the earth. Therefore, in this case, it is quite understandable why the Babylonians would know about it. However, isn’t it odd, since they were not worshipers of Yahweh, that they would come to inquire about the wonder in Judah, from the king of Judah? These were Babylonians and not Israelites from the north.</p><p>Since they came to the King of Judah to make this inquiry, it suggests that they did not experience it themselves but only heard about it.</p><p><strong>In the Land of Judah Only</strong></p><p>If this wonder only took place in the land of Judah and Israel, then it means that the Babylonians did not experience it themselves but only heard about it. This would mean that though we expect the going back or forward of the sun to be equally done every where, it was local to Judah and Israel. This would explain why they came to Judah to inquire about the wonder.</p><h3>Making Sense of This Miracle—Local Going Back of the Sun</h3><ol><li>If it really happened locally, i.e., in Judah and Israel alone, then it means that there may be things we take to be global which are actually local.</li><li>Only the people of Jerusalem/Judah experienced it</li><li>The sun <em>(moon and stars) </em>was created to mark and measure time [Gen 1:3-5;  Gen 1:14-18]</li><li>Therefore, the sun moving backwards means that time was reversed.</li><li>Therefore, since it was only experience or observable in Jerusalem/Judah, Jerusalem/Judah went back in time.</li><li>Since time outside the land was not affected, it means that time can be experienced individually without affecting general time.<ol><li>We would expect Judah’s time to be out of sync with the rest of the world, especially the lands around it, but it evidently isn’t. No effort was made by God to resync Judah’s time with the rest of the world’s. Therefore, general worldwide time was not affected.</li><li>If anyone in Jerusalem went to a neighbouring land after the reversal of the sun, he would that land in the corresponding time, yet the people of that land experienced no reversal of the sun.<br></li></ol></li><li>Therefore, though it really moved, it wasn’t really the sun that moved, but time which it measures that was reversed in Jerusalem/Judah.</li><li>Judah experienced a change in time without altering general time.</li><li><strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>The people of Judah did not go back to the past experiencially—it was just the sun and not they that moved backwards.</li></ol><h3>Some Implications</h3><ol><li>There may be other wonders of God recorded in Scriptures that we naturally think happened worldwide but which happened locally. We would normally have expected the moving backwards of the sun to have been experience or observed all over the earth. People having day time at the time of the event would observe it instantly, and those in the night would experience it in the delay of breaking of day. Yet, this happened locally. Therefore, since this happened locally, there may be other events in the Bible which happened locally that we naturally think happened worldwide.</li><li>The standing still of the sun and moon under Joshua was also local!</li><li>It would be extremely hard, if not outright impossible to find any evidence for this miracle. We shouldn’t be expecting to find records in some place about this event other than in the Bible.</li><li>About time,<ol><li>Time, even time, is an element, it is subject to the power of God</li><li>Time, though perceived as the same worldwide can be local.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Question</strong>: Which is greater, this miracle or the resurrection of the dead?</li></ol>"
